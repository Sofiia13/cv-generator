# CV Generator

**CV Generator** is a web application for quickly creating professional resumes. Users input their personal information, and the app generates a well-formatted document (DOCX) that can be downloaded. The frontend is built with **React + Vite**, the backend with **Node.js + Express**, and **AI (Google Gemini)** is used to polish the text.
